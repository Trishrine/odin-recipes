# odin-recipes

This is a learning project, primarily based around utilizing links and basic html skills.

By the end of the project I should have a pretty brutal looking website, but it should be functional, and should showcase the skills I have picked up over the beginning of the Odin-Project

Despite having learned some html before, this will likely utilize some of the things I learned that were new, and made more sense from an overall perspective.

Hopefully this will be enjoyable, and work relatively well!
