        <h2>Easy Eggs and Rice</h2>
            <p>Breakfast can be hard, especially when you want to eat something that's not cereal and make it out the door in time for work.
                Rice and eggs are a super happy alternative to this. One of the best things about them is that you can make a big batch of rice for the week, refrigerate it, 
                and then warm it backup and just make eggs. They are incredibly easy to season with whatever, and that goes for the rice too! This 
                recipe is amazing becuase it is so customizable, and you will feel so much better walking out the door after making something like this instead of cereal!
